**Title:** 
"Streamlit Diabetes Predictor: A Web Application for Predicting Diabetes Risk"

**Description:**
Our project aims to develop a user-friendly web application using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications, to predict the risk of diabetes based on various health parameters. The application will utilize a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing medical features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and others to provide users with personalized predictions regarding their likelihood of developing diabetes. By offering this predictive tool in an accessible online format, we aim to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their health and potentially take preventive measures to mitigate the risk of diabetes.

**Objective:**
Sure, here's the objective written in list format:

1. Develop a deployable web application.
2. Utilize machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes.
3. Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
4. Enable users to input their health data.
5. Provide instant predictions based on the input data.
6. Raise awareness about diabetes risk factors.
7. Empower users to take proactive steps towards managing their health effectively.
